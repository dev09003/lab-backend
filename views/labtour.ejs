                <p class="card-title">Weighing Balance</p>
                <p class="card-info">An analytical balance is a type of balance that is commonly used for the measurement of mass in the sub-milligram range.

                    Working Principle
                    These types of balances are made with a measuring pan enclosed in a transparent covering that prevents small particles or air currents from getting collected on the pan.
                    An electric analytical balance uses the force necessary to counteract the mass rather than measuring the mass itself.
                    An electromagnet is used to create a force required to achieve a balance with the mass of the substance, and the resulting force is displayed.
                    Uses
                    As they are highly precise and based on advanced technology, analytical balances are explicitly used in laboratories for the effective completion of tasks like weighing test materials and sampling amounts, formulation, density determination, purity analysis, quality control testing, and material and conformance testing</p>
